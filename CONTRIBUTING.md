# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome and appreciated.

Please open a Pull Request containing the changes you'd like to make, meeting the following guidelines:

* **PSR-2 Coding Standards, clean code**
* **Feature branches** I won't accept a PR from your master branch.
* **Cleanish history, atomic commits** I won't accept a PR with half a dozen WIP commits.
* **Tests** I probably won't accept a PR without passing tests for most changes.
* **Documentation** If you change or add behavior, make sure any examples or documentation is up to date, and code is well commented where necessary.
